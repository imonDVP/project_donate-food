                    Hunger is a global crisis which is affecting over 800 million people across the globe. The
                    catastrophic effects of food insecurity mean families can go hungry for days often without knowing
                    where their next meal will come from. <br>
                    Lack of food destroys lives and jeopardises the future of those suffering in many different ways.
                    Factors such as illnesses and low energy levels brought on by food insecurity can restrict people
                    from working as well as providing a sustainable living for their families. As a result those
                    suffering are pushed deeper in to the cycle poverty, impacting not only them but also future
                    generations.

                In my previous post, I outlined the questions I asked myself as I moved from making donations casually
                to creating a more deliberate giving strategy. Once I had determined what was important, I needed to
                figure out how to reflect that in my giving.

                    When you donate to a charity, you make an impact. You help support important causes and projects you
                    care about. Whether you give to an animal welfare fund or another charity, you make a positive
                    difference in the world.Human rights aren’t something that people should have to earn. These
                    fundamental rights encompass the entitlement to life, education, employment, and freedom of
                    expression. Numerous charitable organizations concentrate on fulfilling life’s basic necessities,
                    such as shelter, sustenance, clean water, and education. While the responsibility for looking after
                    individuals within their boundaries falls on governments, it doesn’t consistently occur for various
                    reasons. This is where the significance of charities becomes evident. Moreover, many nonprofit
                    entities ensure governments are held responsible if they transgress human rights themselves.

                    Firstly, the basic need of human beings is shelter. Some humans want to live on their own, but some
                    obstacles are facing them. Individuals who want to fulfil their desires go for the house loan which
                    is provided by the bank. The bank charges a high rate of interest, so this will become a higher risk
                    individual. If the individual does not pay the EMI, then the bank will sell their preferred
                    property. The government of the country also helps people who want to get their own home. To cite an
                    example, a country like India, where the prime minister launched a scheme called the Pardahan Mantri
                    Awas Yojana, which means that the government will give small properties to people who are not able
                    to buy their property at lower EMIs. Secondly, renting a house is also an option to live in. For
                    individuals who have their own house in another place but are living in another place for reasons
                    like study, job placement, etc. , they choose to pay rent to live in the house. For instance, a
                    survey of the country's individuals showed that 40% of the individuals surveyed chose to rent a
                    house. because it is much easier to pay rent when you don't have a burden on your mind To conclude,
                    both owning their propertiy and renting a house are important in an individual's life because they
                    need shelter where they can live with their family and have memorable moments with their family, no
                    matter whether it is their own property or a rented house.
